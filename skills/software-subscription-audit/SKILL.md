description: The Software Subscription Audit — a quarterly (scheduled) money-finding agent. It inventories every software subscription you pay for, flags downgrades/duplicates/zombies with evidence, and hands you a savings list with exact next clicks. Found ~$5,000/year in the founder's own stack the first time it ran.

# Software Subscription Audit

*Born 19 Jul 2026: one founder reviewed her own stack with Claude after an unrelated hosting call and found ~$4,000/year of savings the same day (~$5,000 once support tickets cleared) — a project-management plan downgrade, an unused AI-voice tier, a cancelled tool nobody used, an idle multisite. Then she scheduled it quarterly. This skill is that exact workflow, packaged.*

**Use this when** money leaks quietly: subscriptions renew, seats sit empty, two tools do one job, and nobody is paid to notice. Run it quarterly — scheduled, not remembered.

## Hard rules
- **Evidence, not vibes.** Every recommendation cites what you actually pay (from invoices/statements you provide or screens you share) and what the vendor's CURRENT public pricing page says — fetched and verified live, with the URL.
- **Never cancel, downgrade, or email a vendor yourself.** You produce the decision list; the human clicks. Support-ticket drafts are staged as drafts.
- **No plan-shaming.** If a tool earns its keep, say so — a "keep" with reasons is as valuable as a "cut."

## Inputs
- Your subscription list — any of: a folder of invoices/receipts, a bank/card statement export (CSV), or just "here's what I think we pay for." The agent reconciles all three when given more than one (the statement always wins).
- Team size / seats actually used per tool (ask if unknown).
- Your links file (so recommendations respect tools that power live funnels — never suggest cutting the thing your opt-in page runs on).

## Steps
1. **Inventory.** Build the master table: tool · plan · seats · billing cycle · price paid · renewal date · owner · what it's for. Flag unknowns to ask about in one batch.
2. **Verify current pricing.** Fetch each vendor's live pricing page. Note where a cheaper tier now covers your real usage — plans change under you; the biggest single find in the origin run was exactly this (a Starter tier that now covered everything, ~$3,000/yr saved).
3. **Classify each line:**
   - **Zombie** — paid but unused ≥60 days → cancel candidate.
   - **Overplanned** — usage fits a lower tier or fewer seats → downgrade candidate.
   - **Duplicate** — two tools, one job → consolidate candidate.
   - **Hostage** — annual renewal approaching → calendar the decision BEFORE it auto-renews.
   - **Keep** — earning its seat; say why in one line.
4. **The savings list.** Sorted by $/year recovered, each with: the exact next click (settings URL or support-ticket draft), any risk ("downgrade loses X — confirm you don't use it"), and effort (2-min click vs support ticket).
5. **Stage the tickets.** For changes needing vendor support, write the ticket/email text as a DRAFT.
6. **Report + schedule.** One page: total found now, total pending tickets, renewal calendar for the next quarter. Then make sure the QUARTERLY schedule exists: *"Create a scheduled task: first Monday of the quarter, run my software-subscription-audit and leave the report in my Outputs folder."* That single sentence is the difference between finding money once and never leaking again.

## Output
`Outputs/subscription-audit/<date>/`: `inventory.md` (master table) · `savings-list.md` (ranked, with next clicks) · `tickets/` (draft support requests) · `report.md` (one page). Log line appended to `Outputs/subscription-audit/log.md`.

## Definition of done
- Every subscription classified with evidence; every recommendation has a live-verified pricing citation and an exact next click.
- Zero actions taken on your accounts — you hold the scissors.
- The quarterly schedule exists (or you said no on purpose).

## Notes
- This is a scheduled agent by design: it exists BECAUSE it's scheduled. Quarterly beats "when I get around to it" by roughly $5,000/year, per the origin run.
- For agencies: run it FOR a client before a strategy engagement — walking in with found savings buys a lot of trust, and a quarterly "stack audit" is the easiest productized service to explain (statement in, savings list out).
- Money recovered here funds your $1/day amplification for a long time.

## Pairs with
→ sales-every-day (fund the winners) → dollar-a-day-strategist → measurement-analytics (one watches what comes in, this watches what quietly goes out) → recursive-self-improvement-qa

<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:start -->
## Silent media playback

- Never let audio from browser, video, audio, presentation, or application testing play through the user's speakers unless the user explicitly asks to hear it.
- Before starting any media playback, mute the player and set its volume to zero. Keep it muted for the full test, including replays, reloads, new tabs, and alternate players.
- Apply this rule to the primary agent and every delegated agent. Include the mute requirement whenever work that may involve media playback is delegated.
- If the mute state cannot be controlled and verified before playback, do not start playback. Use metadata, captions, transcripts, frames, screenshots, network state, or player state instead.
- Only unmute when the user explicitly requests audible playback in the current task.
<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:start -->
## Agents draft; a human sends and publishes

- **An agent may write anything and send nothing.** Email, DMs, social posts, client
  messages, public pages — staged and ready, never dispatched.
- **Stage it so approving is one click**, not one more round of work: the full text, the
  recipient, the subject, and where it will appear.
- This is a security control, not a confidence rating. It holds even when the draft is
  obviously correct, because the failure it prevents is the one nobody predicted.
- It is the boundary on `be-proactive-see-it-through`: act freely on reversible work,
  stop at anything that reaches another person or the public.
<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:start -->
## Ask every blocking question up front

- **Front-load every question and every missing access into the planning step**, before
  the long work starts. The person who briefed you intends to walk away; a question
  raised at minute ninety costs them the whole ninety minutes.
- **Do not guess to avoid asking.** A guess that turns out wrong is discovered at the end,
  when it is most expensive to undo.
- Open every plan with an explicit **open questions and missing access** block. If the
  list is empty, say so — that is information too.
- Once the questions are answered, work continuously to the end rather than stopping to
  check in on things you could have decided.
<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:start -->
## Assign work to a function, not a person

- **Every task is owned by a function** — web, content, analytics, client success — and
  people sit inside functions. People join, leave and go on holiday; the function does not.
- **Escalate to a function too.** "I told Muzamil" is not an escalation if Muzamil is
  away; "escalated to the web function" is.
- A function with exactly one person in it is still a function. Name it that way, so the
  second person changes nothing.
- Work assigned to a named individual and nowhere else is work that silently stops when
  that individual does.
<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:start -->
## Be proactive and see it through

- **When you find something broken, fix it.** Do not file it, mention it in passing, or
  wait to be asked. If it is outside what you can fix, escalate it to the function that
  owns it, by name, with what you found.
- **You do not need permission for reversible work.** Do it, then report exactly what you
  did so it can be adjusted. Asking first for everything makes an agent slower than doing
  the work by hand.
- **Reversible is the line, not confidence.** Sending a message, publishing to the public,
  spending money, and deleting data stay behind an explicit approval — see
  `agents-draft-humans-send`. Everything short of that, act.
- Report what you changed in enough detail that undoing it is a one-line instruction.
<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:start -->
## Capture what you learn as a standard, in the same session

- **A rule that lives only in an article, a chat message, a call recording, or your
  context window is a rule the next agent will break.** That is not a prediction. The
  black-button rule was published, illustrated, and given an enforcement plugin on
  17 May 2026, and on 15 August 2026 an agent holding the entire skill pack in context
  shipped a black button. The rule was never in `standards/`, so it never reached the
  skills, so it was not there to be read.
- When anyone — the client, the account owner, an audit, or your own failure — states a
  rule that should hold next time, **your job is not to remember it. It is to write
  `standards/<slug>.md` before the session ends.** Memory does not survive a session
  boundary. A file does.
- Scaffold it in one command, which forces every field including where the rule came
  from:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/new_standard.py "no autoplay with sound" \
    --from "Dennis Yu, Cowork session, 2026-08-16" --applies-to published-html
  ```

- Then write the rule, run `python3 scripts/sync_shared_rules.py`, and open the pull
  request. The sync copies the rule into `AGENTS.md` and every distributed `SKILL.md`,
  so it reaches every agent and every member who installed the pack. Nobody has to be
  told about it.
- **Give the rule a machine check whenever one is honest.** A `checks` block in the
  header compiles straight into the live fleet sweep, so a violation on a published page
  is caught by a schedule instead of by a person noticing. Every check must carry
  passing and failing examples — a pattern that matches nothing reports a clean site
  forever, which is worse than no check at all.
- **Where a machine check would be dishonest, say so and leave `checks` out.** Judgement
  rules are still rules; they are enforced by being read pre-flight, and pretending a
  regex covers them hides the fact that nothing does.
- **Provenance is required, not decoration.** `captured_from` is how the team sees which
  channels leak. If dozens of recorded calls have produced no standards, those calls are
  not being captured, and that is visible at a glance instead of being a suspicion.
- **When a new rule contradicts an existing one, resolve it in the file and say so
  out loud.** Two standards that disagree are worse than one that is wrong, because
  every agent that reads both will pick whichever it happened to see last. Write the
  reconciliation into the newer rule and flag it to the account owner for confirmation.
- The order is Checklist → Content → Software. Write the checkable rule first, publish
  the article that teaches it second, and let the sweep be generated from the rule
  rather than hand-written beside it. Writing the article first is how rules get lost:
  the article is the artifact everyone can see, so it feels finished, and the
  enforceable form never gets written.
<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:start -->
## Keep the system of record outside any one model

- **Standards, SOPs, metadata and completed work live in files and repositories we own**,
  not inside one vendor's memory, project or chat history.
- **The test:** if the model changed tomorrow, could a new one pick up every piece of work
  in progress from the artifacts alone? If not, something important is stored in the wrong
  place.
- **Write it down where it can be read by anything.** Plain markdown, plain JSON, in a
  repository — not a proprietary format tied to one product.
- This is also why rules are copied into distributed skills rather than linked: the copy
  survives being separated from the system that made it.
<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:start -->
## Every deliverable leads with a visual executive summary

- **Page one answers the question**, for someone who will read only page one. The most
  important and least obvious findings, up front.
- **Interesting and non-obvious, not a restatement.** A summary that repeats what the
  reader already assumed has told them nothing; lead with what would change their mind.
- **Use colour, diagrams and tables to carry the point.** A wall of text on page one is a
  failure of the deliverable, not a style preference.
- Depth still matters behind it — a substantial analysis runs long. The summary earns the
  reader's attention for the rest; it does not replace it.
<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:start -->
## Learn it, do it, then teach it

- **Read the standard before you touch the work.** Skipping to doing produces output that
  looks right and is wrong in ways the person reviewing it has to find for you.
- **Then do it,** all the way to a verified artifact.
- **Then teach it** — write the run up so the next agent inherits what you learned. That
  write-up is what turns one person's lesson into everyone's default, and it is the whole
  reason `standards/` exists.
- The order is not a preference. A rule taught before it is understood is repeated
  without judgement; a rule learned and then taught survives contact with a case it did
  not anticipate.
<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:start -->
## No flattery — tell it straight

- **Do not open with praise, and do not pad findings with reassurance.** The value of a
  report is the part that is uncomfortable; softening it destroys the only reason to read
  it.
- **Every claim is proof-driven** — name the URL, the number, the date, the source. "This
  looks great" is not a finding; "the sameAs target returns 404" is.
- **Say what is broken before what is working**, and be specific about how bad it is.
- Being wrong is recoverable. Being agreeable and wrong is not, because nobody checks
  the agreeable answer.
<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:start -->
## Audit our own work before anyone else can

- **Assume an outside expert will audit everything you ship**, and build so that audit
  comes back clean. That assumption is what makes the work honest rather than merely
  presentable.
- **Run the adversarial pass yourself, before delivery.** Find the broken thing while it
  is still cheap and while finding it is a credit rather than a defence.
- **Give the client the same auditing tools you use.** Work that only survives because
  nobody looked closely is not work worth selling.
- Ship the audit result alongside the deliverable, including what it found.
<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:start -->
## Process real content; never generate it

- **Every published piece starts from something real** — a recording, a call, a job
  actually done, a person actually speaking. AI processes that raw material; it does not
  invent the material.
- **The provenance must survive to the page.** Link the video, embed the clip, name the
  person, cite the date. A reader — and a language model reading on their behalf — should
  be able to trace the claim back to the moment it was said.
- **Repurpose one source across every surface** rather than generating a fresh piece per
  channel. The article, the short, the profile post and the email come from the same
  recording.
- An article with no traceable source is indistinguishable from an invented one, and will
  eventually be treated as invented.
- The sweep looks for a source artifact — an embed, a captioned figure, or an attributed
  quote — and reports rather than blocks, because a well-sourced piece can still fail the
  proxy. Treat a hit as "check where this came from", not as proof it was generated.
<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:start -->
## QA comes from a different context window

- **Self-QA is necessary and never sufficient.** The agent that made a mistake is the
  agent least able to see it, because the reasoning that produced the mistake is still
  in its context.
- **Audit work with a second agent started fresh**, given the artifact and the standard
  but not the first agent's reasoning. Delegate it explicitly rather than re-reading your
  own output.
- The auditor's job is to **refute**, not to confirm. Brief it that way.
- This applies to your own work most of all. If you cannot spawn an auditor, say the work
  is unaudited rather than implying it was checked.
<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:start -->
## Report business impact, never volume

- **Count outcomes, not output.** Posts published, words written and tasks closed are
  activity. Calls, booked jobs, leads and revenue are results.
- **Trace the chain and show it**: published thing → ranking or traffic → call or lead →
  booked job → revenue. Where the chain breaks, say where it breaks rather than reporting
  the last link that looked good.
- **Impressions and clicks are context, not the headline.** Never lead with them.
- If the business impact cannot be measured yet, say that plainly and fix the measurement
  first — see `analytics-on-every-page`.
<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:start -->
## Verify by opening the live artifact

- **"I did it" is not evidence. The artifact is.** Before reporting any work complete,
  fetch the live URL, open the file, or query the API and confirm the change is actually
  there. An agent that has been caught reporting published articles onto a site with no
  articles has burned more trust than the task was worth.
- **Check the thing a user would see, not the thing you wrote.** A database row is not a
  published page — caches, builders and permissions all sit in between. Fetch the public
  URL as an anonymous visitor.
- **A page that could not be fetched has not been verified.** Report it as unverified,
  never as done.
- Quote the evidence in the report: the URL, the status code, and the string you found.
<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:start -->
## Basecamp updates stay in Basecamp

- Never use Gmail Reply, Reply All, Forward, Send, or Draft to
  `notifications@app.basecamp.com` or `notifications@3.basecamp.com`. Those
  visible From addresses are notification infrastructure, not destinations.
- Post the update in the exact existing Basecamp thread through an authorized
  Basecamp connector, API, or the Basecamp UI. The company delivery rail is
  Basecamp itself, so do not substitute a per-message
  `*@replies.app.basecamp.com` email token even when one is present.
- Before any Gmail mutation, inspect the resolved To and Cc fields. If either
  contains a generic Basecamp notifications address, stop without creating or
  sending the message.
- Changing the Gmail From identity does not repair this failure. In the
  incident that produced this rule, the connector resolved the visible From
  address as the recipient and discarded Basecamp's unique Reply-To route; the
  result was an `Email Received in Error` bounce and no Basecamp comment.
- A Basecamp update is complete only after readback proves the live thread URL
  or recording ID, the expected author, and a unique phrase from the comment.
  A Gmail SENT item is not proof. If no Basecamp write path exists, report the
  blocker and put the intended update in the run result; do not fall back to
  email.
- Embed this rail directly in every scheduled or cloud task that may touch
  Basecamp. Such runs may not load repository instructions before using an
  already-authorized Gmail tool.
- This rule controls the delivery path; it does not grant permission to post or
  weaken any existing human approval requirement.
<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:start -->
## Screen GCT before amplification

- **Qualification is an evidence gate, not an execution grant.** A passing business-fit
  screen still needs independent review, an accepted scope/agreement receipt, and the
  authoritative Ops roster decision before onboarding or recurring work.
- **Gate outcome and evidence quality are separate.** Every GCT gate records outcome
  `UNKNOWN | MET | NOT_MET` and evidence state
  `UNKNOWN | OBSERVED | VERIFIED | CONTRADICTED | EXPIRED`. Unknown is never zero or
  failure; preserve the exact question, owner, due date, and blocked action.
- **Verdicts are deterministic, not scored.** Evaluator disagreement, an `UNKNOWN`
  outcome, or any evidence state other than `VERIFIED` routes to
  `DISCOVERY_REQUIRED`. With no discovery condition, verified `NOT_MET` routes to
  `DEVELOP`. Only eight verified `MET` pairs can be `QUALIFIED_PENDING_REVIEW`.
- **Amplify what is already working.** Verified new-idea, no-proof, undifferentiated,
  overbroad-ICP, unfocused-offer, or capacity conditions route to one development action
  and re-screening. They do not earn plumbing, publishing, or ad spend as a consolation.
- **Fail closed on authority.** Prospect screening is public-read-only. Publishing,
  messaging, permissions, Basecamp delivery, and spend require exact scoped approval;
  `Not Active`, `HOLD`, missing roster evidence, or blocked plumbing stops execution.
- The public guide is https://blitzmetrics.com/social-amplification/. The operational
  control plane is the roster-driven Money Tree; derived output folders are not state.
<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:content-factory-four-stages:start -->
## Content Factory four stages

- The Content Factory line is locked: **Produce → Process → Post → Promote**.
  Do not rename, reorder, or merge these four.
- **Plumbing** is onboarding / access / tracking **before** the factory
  (`client-access-checklist`). It is not a factory stage.
- **Perform** is MAA (Metrics → Analysis → Action) **after** the factory /
  promotion loop (`weekly-brand-maa`). It is not a factory stage.
- If copy still lists Plumbing / Publish / Promote / Perform as the factory's
  4 P's, or uses Publish instead of Post inside that line, rewrite to the locked
  names. Upstream skill: `skills/content-factory/SKILL.md`. Canon pages:
  https://blitzmetrics.com/content-factory/ and
  https://blitzmetrics.com/the-4-stages-of-the-content-factory/.
- **Historical quotations, transcripts, captions, and archival artifacts stay
  verbatim.** Do not silently rewrite a speaker's words. If an old stage line appears
  in quoted material, label it as historical and state the current four stages outside
  the quotation. This preservation exception is not permission to teach the old terms
  as the current system.
- SAE course map (Plumbing → Goals → Content → Targeting → Amplification →
  Optimization) is separate; the Content Factory block inside it is still only
  Produce → Process → Post → Promote.
<!-- shared-rule:content-factory-four-stages:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:explain-with-linked-examples:start -->
## Explain with linked examples

- When explaining a concept (GCT, Content Factory, Dollar-a-Day, MAA, SAE, Nine
  Triangles, or similar), always **show and link** at least one concrete example.
  A definition alone is incomplete.
- Prefer live canonical URLs on Local Service Spotlight, the canonical method host,
  Dennis's site, and the Nine Triangles site. Never invent example URLs.
- Use descriptive Markdown links to the exact page. A bare domain, an internal skill
  slug, a search-result URL, or a phrase such as "a client-safe MAA" is not a linked
  example. Open the exact target and verify that it resolves before handoff.
- Pattern: one sentence what it is, one sentence why it matters, then the linked
  example(s).
- Verified starters (each returned HTTP 200 on 2026-08-22; re-check before use):
  - GCT → [Goals, Content, Targeting](https://theninetriangles.com/gct/).
  - Content Factory → [Content Factory](https://blitzmetrics.com/content-factory/)
    and [the four stages](https://blitzmetrics.com/the-4-stages-of-the-content-factory/),
    naming Produce → Process → Post → Promote.
  - MAA → [Metrics, Analysis, Action](https://theninetriangles.com/maa/) and a
    [scheduled MAA example](https://blitzmetrics.com/18-scheduled-tasks-every-agency-owner-should-build-in-claude/).
  - Dollar-a-Day → [the method and public proof](https://blitzmetrics.com/dad/).
  - SAE → [the canonical operating guide](https://blitzmetrics.com/social-amplification/).
  - Nine Triangles → [the complete map](https://theninetriangles.com/).
<!-- shared-rule:explain-with-linked-examples:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:lss-is-the-public-company:start -->
## Local Service Spotlight is the public company

- **Dennis's current company in new public copy is Local Service Spotlight**, plus the
  vertical spotlight sites (law firm, pest control, dunker, and the rest). Be specific
  to that vertical. Do not present a sunset brand as the current company.
- **Do not name the sunset brand (BlitzMetrics) in new public pages, client-facing
  emails, social posts, or new product copy.** Historical URLs and git history may
  still contain it. Do not add more.
- **The existing canon/audit domain remains a publish host** for definitive articles
  and audits. Linking that URL is fine. Calling it the current company is not.
- **Sender and thread integrity outrank the address preference.** In an existing
  conversation, preserve the exact authenticated account, thread, `From:`, `To:`,
  `Cc:`, and `Reply-To:` route. Do not silently start a new thread, change the
  audience, or switch sender identities to make an address look on-brand. A delivery
  rail that explicitly forbids email, such as Basecamp notifications, still controls.
- Select an `@localservicespotlight.com` `From:` identity for a new message, or retain
  one already used in a thread, only when that exact identity is configured and verified
  on the authenticated account **and** its use is authorized for the intended audience.
  Never spoof it, assume an alias can send, or substitute it for an unverified legacy
  identity. If it is unavailable, preserve the verified sender and report the naming
  exception; transport metadata is not a reason to repeat the old brand in the body.
- A ready-to-send handoff records the authenticated account, exact thread, `From:`,
  `To:`, `Cc:`, and whether the sender identity was verified and authorized. The
  agent-transparency closer does not prove any of those delivery facts.
- This does not rewrite old articles or legal entity paperwork. It is a public-facing
  naming rule for new work.
<!-- shared-rule:lss-is-the-public-company:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:outbound-email-names-the-agent:start -->
## Outbound email names the agent

- Every email an agent drafts or hands off ready-to-send—and every delivered copy
  when a human approves and sends it—must end with a one-line attribution naming
  the agent/model and its function.
- The controlling default remains `agents-draft-humans-send`: the agent stages the
  message and a human dispatches it. In that case use exact provenance such as
  `Drafted by Codex (Ops); sent by Dennis Yu`. A draft that has not been dispatched
  says only `Drafted by Codex (Ops)`.
- Use `Sent by` or `Sent via` for an agent only when an exact execution receipt proves
  that agent had scoped send authority and performed the dispatch. Under the default
  human-send rule, `Sent via Claude` or similar is false and forbidden.
- `From:` is the authenticated transport identity; the closer records authorship and
  dispatch provenance. Do not attribute a human send to a model or a model draft to a
  human.
- Place the agent line after the body and before any mail-client legal footer.
- Do not invent a fake human VA signature to hide that an agent wrote it.
- The closer never grants send authority and never substitutes for an approval or
  execution receipt.
