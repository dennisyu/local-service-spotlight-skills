description: Apply the versioned Nine Triangles operational reference and resolve conflicting or reconstructed triangle names. Use when someone asks for the Nine Triangles, ACC versus AEC, SBP versus ABP, MAA, GCT, DDD, CID, LDT, CCS, or MOF; when mapping a marketing or operations problem to the framework; or when auditing a copied course, article, prompt, or skill pack for framework drift.
---

# Nine Triangles

Use the versioned names in `references/canonical-framework.md`. Read that reference
whenever exact names, source authority, or historical aliases matter. Do not rebuild
the framework from search snippets or memory.

## Apply the framework

1. State the business problem and desired result in one sentence.
2. Select the one triangle that directly governs the next decision. Do not force all
   nine into every analysis.
3. Evaluate all three corners separately. Record evidence for each corner; do not
   let strength in one hide a missing second or third corner.
4. Identify the weakest corner and convert it into one owner, action, deadline, and
   success measure.
5. Use MAA on the next review: measure the result, analyze why it moved, then choose
   the next action.
6. Report the framework version and acceptance status exactly as recorded in the
   reference so copied packs can be reconciled later. Do not call a candidate
   reference canonical.

## Guardrails

- Treat legacy aliases as aliases, not extra triangles.
- Never call a vendor or WordPress plugin part of the Nine Triangles. Link Whisper,
  Yoast, HighLevel, DataForSEO, and similar tools are optional implementation choices.
- Do not recommend a tool merely because an old pack named it. Verify that it is
  required, currently supported, safe, and the simplest fit for the action.
- Do not redistribute paid course material. Provide the operational names and
  workflow here, then link to the authorized course or definitive article for the
  full curriculum.
- When two Local Service Spotlight sources disagree, name the discrepancy and follow the
  authority order in the reference. Never silently choose the wording that makes a
  clean-looking answer.

## Output

Return:

- selected triangle and exact three corners;
- evidence and gap for each corner;
- weakest corner;
- one accountable next action with deadline and metric;
- framework version and any legacy alias encountered.

Pair with `measurement-analytics` for MAA data, `content-factory` for GCT and
funnel execution, and `skill-registry` when a copied pack needs reconciliation.

<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:start -->
## Silent media playback

- Never let audio from browser, video, audio, presentation, or application testing play through the user's speakers unless the user explicitly asks to hear it.
- Before starting any media playback, mute the player and set its volume to zero. Keep it muted for the full test, including replays, reloads, new tabs, and alternate players.
- Apply this rule to the primary agent and every delegated agent. Include the mute requirement whenever work that may involve media playback is delegated.
- If the mute state cannot be controlled and verified before playback, do not start playback. Use metadata, captions, transcripts, frames, screenshots, network state, or player state instead.
- Only unmute when the user explicitly requests audible playback in the current task.
<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:start -->
## Agents draft; a human sends and publishes

- **An agent may write anything and send nothing.** Email, DMs, social posts, client
  messages, public pages — staged and ready, never dispatched.
- **Stage it so approving is one click**, not one more round of work: the full text, the
  recipient, the subject, and where it will appear.
- This is a security control, not a confidence rating. It holds even when the draft is
  obviously correct, because the failure it prevents is the one nobody predicted.
- It is the boundary on `be-proactive-see-it-through`: act freely on reversible work,
  stop at anything that reaches another person or the public.
<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:start -->
## Ask every blocking question up front

- **Front-load every question and every missing access into the planning step**, before
  the long work starts. The person who briefed you intends to walk away; a question
  raised at minute ninety costs them the whole ninety minutes.
- **Do not guess to avoid asking.** A guess that turns out wrong is discovered at the end,
  when it is most expensive to undo.
- Open every plan with an explicit **open questions and missing access** block. If the
  list is empty, say so — that is information too.
- Once the questions are answered, work continuously to the end rather than stopping to
  check in on things you could have decided.
<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:start -->
## Assign work to a function, not a person

- **Every task is owned by a function** — web, content, analytics, client success — and
  people sit inside functions. People join, leave and go on holiday; the function does not.
- **Escalate to a function too.** "I told Muzamil" is not an escalation if Muzamil is
  away; "escalated to the web function" is.
- A function with exactly one person in it is still a function. Name it that way, so the
  second person changes nothing.
- Work assigned to a named individual and nowhere else is work that silently stops when
  that individual does.
<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:start -->
## Be proactive and see it through

- **When you find something broken, fix it.** Do not file it, mention it in passing, or
  wait to be asked. If it is outside what you can fix, escalate it to the function that
  owns it, by name, with what you found.
- **You do not need permission for reversible work.** Do it, then report exactly what you
  did so it can be adjusted. Asking first for everything makes an agent slower than doing
  the work by hand.
- **Reversible is the line, not confidence.** Sending a message, publishing to the public,
  spending money, and deleting data stay behind an explicit approval — see
  `agents-draft-humans-send`. Everything short of that, act.
- Report what you changed in enough detail that undoing it is a one-line instruction.
<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:start -->
## Capture what you learn as a standard, in the same session

- **A rule that lives only in an article, a chat message, a call recording, or your
  context window is a rule the next agent will break.** That is not a prediction. The
  black-button rule was published, illustrated, and given an enforcement plugin on
  17 May 2026, and on 15 August 2026 an agent holding the entire skill pack in context
  shipped a black button. The rule was never in `standards/`, so it never reached the
  skills, so it was not there to be read.
- When anyone — the client, the account owner, an audit, or your own failure — states a
  rule that should hold next time, **your job is not to remember it. It is to write
  `standards/<slug>.md` before the session ends.** Memory does not survive a session
  boundary. A file does.
- Scaffold it in one command, which forces every field including where the rule came
  from:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/new_standard.py "no autoplay with sound" \
    --from "Dennis Yu, Cowork session, 2026-08-16" --applies-to published-html
  ```

- Then write the rule, run `python3 scripts/sync_shared_rules.py`, and open the pull
  request. The sync copies the rule into `AGENTS.md` and every distributed `SKILL.md`,
  so it reaches every agent and every member who installed the pack. Nobody has to be
  told about it.
- **Give the rule a machine check whenever one is honest.** A `checks` block in the
  header compiles straight into the live fleet sweep, so a violation on a published page
  is caught by a schedule instead of by a person noticing. Every check must carry
  passing and failing examples — a pattern that matches nothing reports a clean site
  forever, which is worse than no check at all.
- **Where a machine check would be dishonest, say so and leave `checks` out.** Judgement
  rules are still rules; they are enforced by being read pre-flight, and pretending a
  regex covers them hides the fact that nothing does.
- **Provenance is required, not decoration.** `captured_from` is how the team sees which
  channels leak. If dozens of recorded calls have produced no standards, those calls are
  not being captured, and that is visible at a glance instead of being a suspicion.
- **When a new rule contradicts an existing one, resolve it in the file and say so
  out loud.** Two standards that disagree are worse than one that is wrong, because
  every agent that reads both will pick whichever it happened to see last. Write the
  reconciliation into the newer rule and flag it to the account owner for confirmation.
- The order is Checklist → Content → Software. Write the checkable rule first, publish
  the article that teaches it second, and let the sweep be generated from the rule
  rather than hand-written beside it. Writing the article first is how rules get lost:
  the article is the artifact everyone can see, so it feels finished, and the
  enforceable form never gets written.
<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:start -->
## Keep the system of record outside any one model

- **Standards, SOPs, metadata and completed work live in files and repositories we own**,
  not inside one vendor's memory, project or chat history.
- **The test:** if the model changed tomorrow, could a new one pick up every piece of work
  in progress from the artifacts alone? If not, something important is stored in the wrong
  place.
- **Write it down where it can be read by anything.** Plain markdown, plain JSON, in a
  repository — not a proprietary format tied to one product.
- This is also why rules are copied into distributed skills rather than linked: the copy
  survives being separated from the system that made it.
<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:start -->
## Every deliverable leads with a visual executive summary

- **Page one answers the question**, for someone who will read only page one. The most
  important and least obvious findings, up front.
- **Interesting and non-obvious, not a restatement.** A summary that repeats what the
  reader already assumed has told them nothing; lead with what would change their mind.
- **Use colour, diagrams and tables to carry the point.** A wall of text on page one is a
  failure of the deliverable, not a style preference.
- Depth still matters behind it — a substantial analysis runs long. The summary earns the
  reader's attention for the rest; it does not replace it.
<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:start -->
## Learn it, do it, then teach it

- **Read the standard before you touch the work.** Skipping to doing produces output that
  looks right and is wrong in ways the person reviewing it has to find for you.
- **Then do it,** all the way to a verified artifact.
- **Then teach it** — write the run up so the next agent inherits what you learned. That
  write-up is what turns one person's lesson into everyone's default, and it is the whole
  reason `standards/` exists.
- The order is not a preference. A rule taught before it is understood is repeated
  without judgement; a rule learned and then taught survives contact with a case it did
  not anticipate.
<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:start -->
## No flattery — tell it straight

- **Do not open with praise, and do not pad findings with reassurance.** The value of a
  report is the part that is uncomfortable; softening it destroys the only reason to read
  it.
- **Every claim is proof-driven** — name the URL, the number, the date, the source. "This
  looks great" is not a finding; "the sameAs target returns 404" is.
- **Say what is broken before what is working**, and be specific about how bad it is.
- Being wrong is recoverable. Being agreeable and wrong is not, because nobody checks
  the agreeable answer.
<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:start -->
## Audit our own work before anyone else can

- **Assume an outside expert will audit everything you ship**, and build so that audit
  comes back clean. That assumption is what makes the work honest rather than merely
  presentable.
- **Run the adversarial pass yourself, before delivery.** Find the broken thing while it
  is still cheap and while finding it is a credit rather than a defence.
- **Give the client the same auditing tools you use.** Work that only survives because
  nobody looked closely is not work worth selling.
- Ship the audit result alongside the deliverable, including what it found.
<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:start -->
## Process real content; never generate it

- **Every published piece starts from something real** — a recording, a call, a job
  actually done, a person actually speaking. AI processes that raw material; it does not
  invent the material.
- **The provenance must survive to the page.** Link the video, embed the clip, name the
  person, cite the date. A reader — and a language model reading on their behalf — should
  be able to trace the claim back to the moment it was said.
- **Repurpose one source across every surface** rather than generating a fresh piece per
  channel. The article, the short, the profile post and the email come from the same
  recording.
- An article with no traceable source is indistinguishable from an invented one, and will
  eventually be treated as invented.
- The sweep looks for a source artifact — an embed, a captioned figure, or an attributed
  quote — and reports rather than blocks, because a well-sourced piece can still fail the
  proxy. Treat a hit as "check where this came from", not as proof it was generated.
<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:start -->
## QA comes from a different context window

- **Self-QA is necessary and never sufficient.** The agent that made a mistake is the
  agent least able to see it, because the reasoning that produced the mistake is still
  in its context.
- **Audit work with a second agent started fresh**, given the artifact and the standard
  but not the first agent's reasoning. Delegate it explicitly rather than re-reading your
  own output.
- The auditor's job is to **refute**, not to confirm. Brief it that way.
- This applies to your own work most of all. If you cannot spawn an auditor, say the work
  is unaudited rather than implying it was checked.
<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:start -->
## Report business impact, never volume

- **Count outcomes, not output.** Posts published, words written and tasks closed are
  activity. Calls, booked jobs, leads and revenue are results.
- **Trace the chain and show it**: published thing → ranking or traffic → call or lead →
  booked job → revenue. Where the chain breaks, say where it breaks rather than reporting
  the last link that looked good.
- **Impressions and clicks are context, not the headline.** Never lead with them.
- If the business impact cannot be measured yet, say that plainly and fix the measurement
  first — see `analytics-on-every-page`.
<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:start -->
## Verify by opening the live artifact

- **"I did it" is not evidence. The artifact is.** Before reporting any work complete,
  fetch the live URL, open the file, or query the API and confirm the change is actually
  there. An agent that has been caught reporting published articles onto a site with no
  articles has burned more trust than the task was worth.
- **Check the thing a user would see, not the thing you wrote.** A database row is not a
  published page — caches, builders and permissions all sit in between. Fetch the public
  URL as an anonymous visitor.
- **A page that could not be fetched has not been verified.** Report it as unverified,
  never as done.
- Quote the evidence in the report: the URL, the status code, and the string you found.
<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:start -->
## Basecamp updates stay in Basecamp

- Never use Gmail Reply, Reply All, Forward, Send, or Draft to
  `notifications@app.basecamp.com` or `notifications@3.basecamp.com`. Those
  visible From addresses are notification infrastructure, not destinations.
- Post the update in the exact existing Basecamp thread through an authorized
  Basecamp connector, API, or the Basecamp UI. The company delivery rail is
  Basecamp itself, so do not substitute a per-message
  `*@replies.app.basecamp.com` email token even when one is present.
- Before any Gmail mutation, inspect the resolved To and Cc fields. If either
  contains a generic Basecamp notifications address, stop without creating or
  sending the message.
- Changing the Gmail From identity does not repair this failure. In the
  incident that produced this rule, the connector resolved the visible From
  address as the recipient and discarded Basecamp's unique Reply-To route; the
  result was an `Email Received in Error` bounce and no Basecamp comment.
- A Basecamp update is complete only after readback proves the live thread URL
  or recording ID, the expected author, and a unique phrase from the comment.
  A Gmail SENT item is not proof. If no Basecamp write path exists, report the
  blocker and put the intended update in the run result; do not fall back to
  email.
- Embed this rail directly in every scheduled or cloud task that may touch
  Basecamp. Such runs may not load repository instructions before using an
  already-authorized Gmail tool.
- This rule controls the delivery path; it does not grant permission to post or
  weaken any existing human approval requirement.
<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:start -->
## Screen GCT before amplification

- **Do not run Dollar a Day, conversion campaigns, or SAE Stage 5 amplification** until `gct-screen` is an independent-review candidate (`QUALIFIED_PENDING_REVIEW`), a second evaluator has approved, Ops has an exact `Active Client` row, and plumbing is verified green. Amplify what is already working. A new idea has nothing to amplify.
- **Fail closed** when completed research shows a new idea, no independent proof, an undifferentiated offer in a competitive market, serving everyone, or too many products with no clear process. `UNKNOWN` is not a fail and is not zero.
- **Do not invent a 0–100 readiness score.** The public inventory at https://blitzmetrics.com/social-amplification/ is eight evidence gates. A public or first-pass `QUALIFIED_PENDING_REVIEW` is a candidate, not a client and not permission to onboard, publish, or spend.
- **DEVELOP is not a candidate.** Positioning (`business-brand-strategist`) and proof harvest are the next skills. Plumbing and ads are not a consolation prize.
- This rule is the gate in front of `social-amplification-engine` and `dollar-a-day-strategist`.
<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:end -->
