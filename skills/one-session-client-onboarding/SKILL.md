# One-session client onboarding

**Use this when** a new client signs up, an onboarding is split across multiple calls, or someone asks how we onboard. The destination is an agent-run session, not a better project-management SOP.

**The rule:** a human is not the routing layer. `gct-screen` already produced an
evidence-linked `QUALIFIED_PENDING_REVIEW` result, an independent reviewer agreed, an
accepted engagement receipt exists, and Ops made the authoritative roster decision.
The agent prefills GCT. The one session is confirm plus access. First Friday MAA is the
certainty date. Do not add form fields for the client to fill.

## Why

Most agencies do 2 or 3 sessions (access, then GMB/LSA, then content approval). That drags into weeks and the client wonders when work starts. Tony Ricketts does it in one call, but he is fully manual and it takes up to 3 hours. We copy the outcome (one session, then execution) not the duration.

White glove means we fill the forms. Agents do most of the work from the audit already run. The client confirms and clicks access.

Project boards are a temporary window so a human can see the work. They are not the system of record. If the skill, the access list, the prefilled GCT, and the Friday MAA date already exist, nothing should wait on a person to remember, assign, or chase it.

## Before the session (agent, no client time)

1. Confirm the accepted scope/agreement receipt and the authoritative roster row. `Not
   Active`, status-unconfirmed, absent scope, or `HOLD` stops. A qualification result is
   not an engagement.
2. Read the accepted `gct-screen` brief and independent review. Never replace unknowns
   with zero or invent a weighted score.
3. Run `client-access-checklist` against public HTML and authorized credential references.
   Ask only for rows that are actually missing. Never add users, mint credentials, or
   change permissions without the account owner's action/approval.
4. Prefill GCT (Goals, Content, Targeting) from the accepted screen, quick audit, site,
   GBP, and ads. Revenue, services, geo, CRM, and review process are agent-researched
   first. The client confirms; they do not type a biography.
5. Generate **one** client requirement list: only the missing access rows plus any asset the audit cannot see. One list, one owner, one date.
6. Use the existing verified project and channel mapping. Do not create a duplicate
   project or add a person from an agent-only run. One list for their asks, one internal
   list for ours; stage client-visible writes unless the exact delivery policy authorizes them.
7. Write the certainty date: first Friday MAA after the session. Not "2-4 weeks."

## The session (target under 90 minutes)

This is access plus confirm. It is not a sales close and not a 3-hour discovery.

1. Walk the prefilled GCT. Client corrects, does not start from a blank form.
2. Grant access for every missing row. Client keeps owner. We take partner/manager. Mint a CMS application password in the same sitting. Prefer a person user, not a shared admin.
3. Confirm the one requirement list is empty or has a named owner and date for anything still blocked.
4. Lock week-one cadence: one touch per week through month one (MAA every Friday; extra only if a to-do is still open).
5. Say the Friday date out loud. That is when they see the first report.

Do not schedule a second call to "finish access" or "finish the form." Anything left is a to-do with an owner and a date, chased by the next agent run against the artifact, not against a reply.

## After the session (agent)

1. Re-run the access audit. Rows 1-4 green, or a routed blocker with owner and date.
2. Record credentials and the register. A credential that arrived is not a credential that works: probe it on the live target before clearing the row.
3. Post the session receipt: what went green, what is blocked, the Friday MAA date, whether it was one session.
4. Start the weekly MAA loop. Silence is valid when nothing material changed.

## Metrics

- Days from signup to first Friday MAA (target: that Friday)
- Sessions used (target: 1)
- Percent of GCT fields prefilled by the agent before the client saw them
- Access rows 1-4 green at end of session
- Open client to-dos older than 7 days (should be 0, or named with a date)

## Do not

- Add more discovery questions to the client form
- Invent a 3-hour discovery call for an account owner to run
- Leave access as "someone will schedule a call"
- Treat a page or a project thread as the process
- Route work to the nearest human
- Enter a password into a login form
- Start work on a dead engagement

<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:start -->
## Silent media playback

- Never let audio from browser, video, audio, presentation, or application testing play through the user's speakers unless the user explicitly asks to hear it.
- Before starting any media playback, mute the player and set its volume to zero. Keep it muted for the full test, including replays, reloads, new tabs, and alternate players.
- Apply this rule to the primary agent and every delegated agent. Include the mute requirement whenever work that may involve media playback is delegated.
- If the mute state cannot be controlled and verified before playback, do not start playback. Use metadata, captions, transcripts, frames, screenshots, network state, or player state instead.
- Only unmute when the user explicitly requests audible playback in the current task.
<!-- shared-rule:silent-media-playback:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:start -->
## Agents draft; a human sends and publishes

- **An agent may write anything and send nothing.** Email, DMs, social posts, client
  messages, public pages — staged and ready, never dispatched.
- **Stage it so approving is one click**, not one more round of work: the full text, the
  recipient, the subject, and where it will appear.
- This is a security control, not a confidence rating. It holds even when the draft is
  obviously correct, because the failure it prevents is the one nobody predicted.
- It is the boundary on `be-proactive-see-it-through`: act freely on reversible work,
  stop at anything that reaches another person or the public.
<!-- shared-rule:agents-draft-humans-send:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:start -->
## Ask every blocking question up front

- **Front-load every question and every missing access into the planning step**, before
  the long work starts. The person who briefed you intends to walk away; a question
  raised at minute ninety costs them the whole ninety minutes.
- **Do not guess to avoid asking.** A guess that turns out wrong is discovered at the end,
  when it is most expensive to undo.
- Open every plan with an explicit **open questions and missing access** block. If the
  list is empty, say so — that is information too.
- Once the questions are answered, work continuously to the end rather than stopping to
  check in on things you could have decided.
<!-- shared-rule:ask-blocking-questions-up-front:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:start -->
## Assign work to a function, not a person

- **Every task is owned by a function** — web, content, analytics, client success — and
  people sit inside functions. People join, leave and go on holiday; the function does not.
- **Escalate to a function too.** "I told Muzamil" is not an escalation if Muzamil is
  away; "escalated to the web function" is.
- A function with exactly one person in it is still a function. Name it that way, so the
  second person changes nothing.
- Work assigned to a named individual and nowhere else is work that silently stops when
  that individual does.
<!-- shared-rule:assign-work-to-a-function:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:start -->
## Be proactive and see it through

- **When you find something broken, fix it.** Do not file it, mention it in passing, or
  wait to be asked. If it is outside what you can fix, escalate it to the function that
  owns it, by name, with what you found.
- **You do not need permission for reversible work.** Do it, then report exactly what you
  did so it can be adjusted. Asking first for everything makes an agent slower than doing
  the work by hand.
- **Reversible is the line, not confidence.** Sending a message, publishing to the public,
  spending money, and deleting data stay behind an explicit approval — see
  `agents-draft-humans-send`. Everything short of that, act.
- Report what you changed in enough detail that undoing it is a one-line instruction.
<!-- shared-rule:be-proactive-see-it-through:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:start -->
## Capture what you learn as a standard, in the same session

- **A rule that lives only in an article, a chat message, a call recording, or your
  context window is a rule the next agent will break.** That is not a prediction. The
  black-button rule was published, illustrated, and given an enforcement plugin on
  17 May 2026, and on 15 August 2026 an agent holding the entire skill pack in context
  shipped a black button. The rule was never in `standards/`, so it never reached the
  skills, so it was not there to be read.
- When anyone — the client, the account owner, an audit, or your own failure — states a
  rule that should hold next time, **your job is not to remember it. It is to write
  `standards/<slug>.md` before the session ends.** Memory does not survive a session
  boundary. A file does.
- Scaffold it in one command, which forces every field including where the rule came
  from:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/new_standard.py "no autoplay with sound" \
    --from "Dennis Yu, Cowork session, 2026-08-16" --applies-to published-html
  ```

- Then write the rule, run `python3 scripts/sync_shared_rules.py`, and open the pull
  request. The sync copies the rule into `AGENTS.md` and every distributed `SKILL.md`,
  so it reaches every agent and every member who installed the pack. Nobody has to be
  told about it.
- **Give the rule a machine check whenever one is honest.** A `checks` block in the
  header compiles straight into the live fleet sweep, so a violation on a published page
  is caught by a schedule instead of by a person noticing. Every check must carry
  passing and failing examples — a pattern that matches nothing reports a clean site
  forever, which is worse than no check at all.
- **Where a machine check would be dishonest, say so and leave `checks` out.** Judgement
  rules are still rules; they are enforced by being read pre-flight, and pretending a
  regex covers them hides the fact that nothing does.
- **Provenance is required, not decoration.** `captured_from` is how the team sees which
  channels leak. If dozens of recorded calls have produced no standards, those calls are
  not being captured, and that is visible at a glance instead of being a suspicion.
- **When a new rule contradicts an existing one, resolve it in the file and say so
  out loud.** Two standards that disagree are worse than one that is wrong, because
  every agent that reads both will pick whichever it happened to see last. Write the
  reconciliation into the newer rule and flag it to the account owner for confirmation.
- The order is Checklist → Content → Software. Write the checkable rule first, publish
  the article that teaches it second, and let the sweep be generated from the rule
  rather than hand-written beside it. Writing the article first is how rules get lost:
  the article is the artifact everyone can see, so it feels finished, and the
  enforceable form never gets written.
<!-- shared-rule:capture-what-you-learn:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:start -->
## Keep the system of record outside any one model

- **Standards, SOPs, metadata and completed work live in files and repositories we own**,
  not inside one vendor's memory, project or chat history.
- **The test:** if the model changed tomorrow, could a new one pick up every piece of work
  in progress from the artifacts alone? If not, something important is stored in the wrong
  place.
- **Write it down where it can be read by anything.** Plain markdown, plain JSON, in a
  repository — not a proprietary format tied to one product.
- This is also why rules are copied into distributed skills rather than linked: the copy
  survives being separated from the system that made it.
<!-- shared-rule:keep-the-system-of-record-outside-the-model:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:start -->
## Every deliverable leads with a visual executive summary

- **Page one answers the question**, for someone who will read only page one. The most
  important and least obvious findings, up front.
- **Interesting and non-obvious, not a restatement.** A summary that repeats what the
  reader already assumed has told them nothing; lead with what would change their mind.
- **Use colour, diagrams and tables to carry the point.** A wall of text on page one is a
  failure of the deliverable, not a style preference.
- Depth still matters behind it — a substantial analysis runs long. The summary earns the
  reader's attention for the rest; it does not replace it.
<!-- shared-rule:lead-with-a-visual-executive-summary:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:start -->
## Learn it, do it, then teach it

- **Read the standard before you touch the work.** Skipping to doing produces output that
  looks right and is wrong in ways the person reviewing it has to find for you.
- **Then do it,** all the way to a verified artifact.
- **Then teach it** — write the run up so the next agent inherits what you learned. That
  write-up is what turns one person's lesson into everyone's default, and it is the whole
  reason `standards/` exists.
- The order is not a preference. A rule taught before it is understood is repeated
  without judgement; a rule learned and then taught survives contact with a case it did
  not anticipate.
<!-- shared-rule:learn-do-teach:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:start -->
## No flattery — tell it straight

- **Do not open with praise, and do not pad findings with reassurance.** The value of a
  report is the part that is uncomfortable; softening it destroys the only reason to read
  it.
- **Every claim is proof-driven** — name the URL, the number, the date, the source. "This
  looks great" is not a finding; "the sameAs target returns 404" is.
- **Say what is broken before what is working**, and be specific about how bad it is.
- Being wrong is recoverable. Being agreeable and wrong is not, because nobody checks
  the agreeable answer.
<!-- shared-rule:no-flattery-tell-it-straight:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:start -->
## Audit our own work before anyone else can

- **Assume an outside expert will audit everything you ship**, and build so that audit
  comes back clean. That assumption is what makes the work honest rather than merely
  presentable.
- **Run the adversarial pass yourself, before delivery.** Find the broken thing while it
  is still cheap and while finding it is a credit rather than a defence.
- **Give the client the same auditing tools you use.** Work that only survives because
  nobody looked closely is not work worth selling.
- Ship the audit result alongside the deliverable, including what it found.
<!-- shared-rule:pre-audit-before-the-client-does:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:start -->
## Process real content; never generate it

- **Every published piece starts from something real** — a recording, a call, a job
  actually done, a person actually speaking. AI processes that raw material; it does not
  invent the material.
- **The provenance must survive to the page.** Link the video, embed the clip, name the
  person, cite the date. A reader — and a language model reading on their behalf — should
  be able to trace the claim back to the moment it was said.
- **Repurpose one source across every surface** rather than generating a fresh piece per
  channel. The article, the short, the profile post and the email come from the same
  recording.
- An article with no traceable source is indistinguishable from an invented one, and will
  eventually be treated as invented.
- The sweep looks for a source artifact — an embed, a captioned figure, or an attributed
  quote — and reports rather than blocks, because a well-sourced piece can still fail the
  proxy. Treat a hit as "check where this came from", not as proof it was generated.
<!-- shared-rule:process-real-content-never-generate:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:start -->
## QA comes from a different context window

- **Self-QA is necessary and never sufficient.** The agent that made a mistake is the
  agent least able to see it, because the reasoning that produced the mistake is still
  in its context.
- **Audit work with a second agent started fresh**, given the artifact and the standard
  but not the first agent's reasoning. Delegate it explicitly rather than re-reading your
  own output.
- The auditor's job is to **refute**, not to confirm. Brief it that way.
- This applies to your own work most of all. If you cannot spawn an auditor, say the work
  is unaudited rather than implying it was checked.
<!-- shared-rule:qa-from-a-different-context-window:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:start -->
## Report business impact, never volume

- **Count outcomes, not output.** Posts published, words written and tasks closed are
  activity. Calls, booked jobs, leads and revenue are results.
- **Trace the chain and show it**: published thing → ranking or traffic → call or lead →
  booked job → revenue. Where the chain breaks, say where it breaks rather than reporting
  the last link that looked good.
- **Impressions and clicks are context, not the headline.** Never lead with them.
- If the business impact cannot be measured yet, say that plainly and fix the measurement
  first — see `analytics-on-every-page`.
<!-- shared-rule:report-business-impact-not-volume:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:start -->
## Verify by opening the live artifact

- **"I did it" is not evidence. The artifact is.** Before reporting any work complete,
  fetch the live URL, open the file, or query the API and confirm the change is actually
  there. An agent that has been caught reporting published articles onto a site with no
  articles has burned more trust than the task was worth.
- **Check the thing a user would see, not the thing you wrote.** A database row is not a
  published page — caches, builders and permissions all sit in between. Fetch the public
  URL as an anonymous visitor.
- **A page that could not be fetched has not been verified.** Report it as unverified,
  never as done.
- Quote the evidence in the report: the URL, the status code, and the string you found.
<!-- shared-rule:verify-by-opening-the-live-artifact:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:start -->
## Basecamp updates stay in Basecamp

- Never use Gmail Reply, Reply All, Forward, Send, or Draft to
  `notifications@app.basecamp.com` or `notifications@3.basecamp.com`. Those
  visible From addresses are notification infrastructure, not destinations.
- Post the update in the exact existing Basecamp thread through an authorized
  Basecamp connector, API, or the Basecamp UI. The company delivery rail is
  Basecamp itself, so do not substitute a per-message
  `*@replies.app.basecamp.com` email token even when one is present.
- Before any Gmail mutation, inspect the resolved To and Cc fields. If either
  contains a generic Basecamp notifications address, stop without creating or
  sending the message.
- Changing the Gmail From identity does not repair this failure. In the
  incident that produced this rule, the connector resolved the visible From
  address as the recipient and discarded Basecamp's unique Reply-To route; the
  result was an `Email Received in Error` bounce and no Basecamp comment.
- A Basecamp update is complete only after readback proves the live thread URL
  or recording ID, the expected author, and a unique phrase from the comment.
  A Gmail SENT item is not proof. If no Basecamp write path exists, report the
  blocker and put the intended update in the run result; do not fall back to
  email.
- Embed this rail directly in every scheduled or cloud task that may touch
  Basecamp. Such runs may not load repository instructions before using an
  already-authorized Gmail tool.
- This rule controls the delivery path; it does not grant permission to post or
  weaken any existing human approval requirement.
<!-- shared-rule:basecamp-updates-stay-in-basecamp:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:start -->
## Screen GCT before amplification

- **Qualification is an evidence gate, not an execution grant.** A passing business-fit
  screen still needs independent review, an accepted scope/agreement receipt, and the
  authoritative Ops roster decision before onboarding or recurring work.
- **Gate outcome and evidence quality are separate.** Every GCT gate records outcome
  `UNKNOWN | MET | NOT_MET` and evidence state
  `UNKNOWN | OBSERVED | VERIFIED | CONTRADICTED | EXPIRED`. Unknown is never zero or
  failure; preserve the exact question, owner, due date, and blocked action.
- **Verdicts are deterministic, not scored.** Evaluator disagreement, an `UNKNOWN`
  outcome, or any evidence state other than `VERIFIED` routes to
  `DISCOVERY_REQUIRED`. With no discovery condition, verified `NOT_MET` routes to
  `DEVELOP`. Only eight verified `MET` pairs can be `QUALIFIED_PENDING_REVIEW`.
- **Amplify what is already working.** Verified new-idea, no-proof, undifferentiated,
  overbroad-ICP, unfocused-offer, or capacity conditions route to one development action
  and re-screening. They do not earn plumbing, publishing, or ad spend as a consolation.
- **Fail closed on authority.** Prospect screening is public-read-only. Publishing,
  messaging, permissions, Basecamp delivery, and spend require exact scoped approval;
  `Not Active`, `HOLD`, missing roster evidence, or blocked plumbing stops execution.
- The public guide is https://blitzmetrics.com/social-amplification/. The operational
  control plane is the roster-driven Money Tree; derived output folders are not state.
<!-- shared-rule:screen-gct-before-amplification:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:content-factory-four-stages:start -->
## Content Factory four stages

- The Content Factory line is locked: **Produce → Process → Post → Promote**.
  Do not rename, reorder, or merge these four.
- **Plumbing** is onboarding / access / tracking **before** the factory
  (`client-access-checklist`). It is not a factory stage.
- **Perform** is MAA (Metrics → Analysis → Action) **after** the factory /
  promotion loop (`weekly-brand-maa`). It is not a factory stage.
- If copy still lists Plumbing / Publish / Promote / Perform as the factory's
  4 P's, or uses Publish instead of Post inside that line, rewrite to the locked
  names. Upstream skill: `skills/content-factory/SKILL.md`. Canon pages:
  https://blitzmetrics.com/content-factory/ and
  https://blitzmetrics.com/the-4-stages-of-the-content-factory/.
- SAE course map (Plumbing → Goals → Content → Targeting → Amplification →
  Optimization) is separate; the Content Factory block inside it is still only
  Produce → Process → Post → Promote.
<!-- shared-rule:content-factory-four-stages:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:explain-with-linked-examples:start -->
## Explain with linked examples

- When explaining a concept (GCT, Content Factory, Dollar-a-Day, MAA, SAE, Nine
  Triangles, or similar), always **show and link** at least one concrete example.
  A definition alone is incomplete.
- Prefer live canonical URLs: Task Library, Local Service Spotlight, blitzmetrics.com
  SEO leaves, dennisyu.com. Never invent example URLs.
- Pattern: one sentence what it is, one sentence why it matters, then the linked
  example(s).
- Starters: GCT → Task Library GCT task + theninetriangles.com; Content Factory →
  https://blitzmetrics.com/content-factory/ and name Produce → Process → Post →
  Promote; MAA → weekly-brand-maa / a client-safe Friday MAA; Dollar-a-Day → method
  page + one public-safe winner when available.
<!-- shared-rule:explain-with-linked-examples:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:lss-is-the-public-company:start -->
## Local Service Spotlight is the public company

- **Dennis's current company in new public copy is Local Service Spotlight**, plus the
  vertical spotlight sites (law firm, pest control, dunker, and the rest). Be specific
  to that vertical. Do not present a sunset brand as the current company.
- **Do not name the sunset brand (BlitzMetrics) in new public pages, client-facing
  emails, social posts, or new product copy.** Historical URLs and git history may
  still contain it. Do not add more.
- **The existing canon/audit domain remains a publish host** for definitive articles
  and audits. Linking that URL is fine. Calling it the current company is not.
- Prefer `@localservicespotlight.com` addresses in new mail. Legacy aliases may still
  deliver; they are not a reason to put the sunset name in the body.
- This does not rewrite old articles or legal entity paperwork. It is a public-facing
  naming rule for new work.
<!-- shared-rule:lss-is-the-public-company:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:outbound-email-names-the-agent:start -->
## Every outbound agent action names the agent

- **When agent-authored content reaches another person, name the agent in the
  message itself.** This covers sent email, Basecamp comments and messages,
  DMs, support replies, scheduled reports, and the human-visible receipt for a
  publish or system change. A GitHub commit or private log is supporting
  evidence, not a substitute for visible attribution.
- End with one compact line:

  `Agent receipt: <agent> [<model if known>] · action: <drafted|sent|posted|published|changed> · human review: <reviewed by Dennis|authorized, not separately reviewed|no human review recorded>`

- Put the name a human recognizes first: `Claude`, `Codex`, `Grok`, `Cursor`,
  or the actual agent name. A persona alone is ambiguous; write `Grok — Meter
  Maid`, not only `Meter Maid`. Include the exact model only when the runtime
  exposes it. Otherwise omit it or say `model UNKNOWN`; never infer it from the
  writing style, OAuth client, or vendor name.
- State review truthfully. `Reviewed by Dennis` requires evidence that Dennis
  reviewed that exact message or action. Permission to act is not review, so
  use `authorized, not separately reviewed` when that is what happened. If the
  record is missing, use `no human review recorded`.
- Resolve the exact destination, audience, thread or record before acting. If
  routing or authority is unclear, fail closed instead of sending to Dennis or
  asking him to relay the work.
- An outbound action is complete only after source-system read-back verifies
  the destination/audience, thread or record, intended content/result, and
  agent receipt. A toast, sent item, commit, or private note alone is not proof.
- Leave the next action with its real owner. For completed Gmail work, archive
  the exact thread after verified action and restore it after seven days only
  when no human reply arrived; automation and system notices are not human
  replies.
- Name the agent even when `From:` or the source-system creator is Dennis. That
  identity is the delivery account; the receipt is authorship and action
  transparency. Place the receipt after the body and before any automatic legal
  footer.
- If an agent only prepared material and a human sent the final version, use
  `Prepared with <agent>; sent by <human>` when attribution is appropriate. Do
  not label a purely human-authored message as agent-authored, and never invent
  a fake human assistant signature to hide agent authorship.
- For a public page or code change, put the line in the delivery receipt or
  source-system update; do not add operational metadata to visitor-facing copy
  unless the publishing brief asks for it.
- This rule grants no authority to send, post, publish, spend, merge, or change
  access. Apply the existing approval and destination rules first. Once an
  outbound action is separately authorized, attribution is mandatory. When only
  drafting, include the agent name in the draft so it survives handoff.
- Scheduled prompts that may act externally must explicitly use the
  `outbound-action-closeout` skill and embed its routing, receipt, read-back,
  ownership, and fail-closed rails because an unattended session may not load
  repository rules or prior conversation.
<!-- shared-rule:outbound-email-names-the-agent:end -->

<!-- shared-rule:definitive-articles-show-what-they-are-and-where-they-fit:start -->
## Definitive articles show what they are, their evidence strength, and where they fit

- **The marker is a reviewed semantic claim, not a workflow status.** Mark a page as a
  Definitive Article, Definitive SOP or Definitive Framework only after a reviewer has
  confirmed that its labels, steps, links, evidence and canonical ownership agree with
  the accepted source of truth. A complete Task Library task, an all-tasks-complete hub,
  a taxonomy term or a `READY` state is useful workflow evidence, but none is sufficient
  by itself. An archive, alias, WIP page or semantically conflicted page gets no marker.
- **Mark the reviewed canonical hub visibly.** Put the appropriate marker above the
  opening summary so a reader can distinguish the maintained source of truth from a
  supporting post before scrolling. Supporting stories, updates and meta-articles point
  to the hub; they do not wear the marker themselves.
- **Keep certification, task priority and evidence volume separate.** Definitive status
  says the page is the reviewed canonical owner. Task importance decides which gap to
  work first. Meta-orbit strength measures only the number of verified completed-run
  meta-articles behind the hub. None of the three may be used as a proxy for another.
- **Derive the meta count from evidence; never type it into two sources.** One generated
  manifest owns the exact hub URL, mapped Task Library tasks, every counted and held
  evidence record, audit time, count and strength band. The article badge/footer and the
  Task Library render from that manifest. If the corpus cannot be checked, report
  `unknown`; if only a lower bound is proved, report `partial`. Never turn either into
  zero.
- **Count a primary worked example, not a generic cross-link.** A counted meta-article
  must be published, explicitly classified as a meta-article, document a completed run,
  materially execute the hub's task, and link to the exact canonical hub in its
  task-specific narrative or receipt. A shared framework map, compliance table,
  related-reading list, template, index, instructional page, archive, self-link or
  incidental concept mention does not make the post part of that hub's orbit. Preserve
  the reason for every excluded or held candidate.
- **Use fixed, transparent evidence bands.** Show the exact count next to the definitive
  pill and label 0 as `No verified examples`, 1–2 as `Emerging`, 3–5 as `Supported`,
  6–10 as `Strong`, and 11+ as `Deep`. This label measures documented-run volume only,
  not accuracy, freshness, traffic, quality or certification. Do not emit rating or
  review schema from it.
- **Make the graph work in both directions.** The Task Library task links to the final
  canonical article. The article's generated, collapsed evidence footer links to the
  exact filtered Task Library route and back to every counted meta-article. A stable
  `?task=` route opens one task and a stable `?article=` route opens the complete hub.
  A count without its inspectable source URLs is decoration, not evidence.
- **Lead with the result and the article's own evidence.** Give the 2–3 sentence
  plain-language summary first, then a compact outcome/checklist block. Keep the most
  specific primary visual or proof for that article above the fold: the actual framework
  diagram on a framework hub, the task-specific screenshot or flow on a software SOP,
  or the real photograph, artifact or result that proves the work. A generic system map
  must never displace that evidence or push it below the fold. Move audience explanation,
  history and secondary evidence below this primary orientation.
- **Use the larger system map as truthful context.** When an established framework has
  an exact relationship to the article, place its maintained detailed map after the
  article-specific primary visual and highlight only the subcomponents the article
  actually performs. Keep surrounding components visible but muted and caption what the
  highlight and handoff mean. On a framework hub, the canonical framework diagram is
  itself the primary visual and may serve both purposes.
- **A stage-only highlight or no map is valid.** If the task belongs to a stage but no
  named child station truthfully represents it, highlight only the stage and, where
  useful, its verified boundary or handoff. If no honest placement exists, omit the map
  and explain the cross-system relationship in text. Never activate a nearby box merely
  to make the diagram look complete.
- **Do not redraw a framework from memory.** Reuse the maintained labels, order, palette
  and relationships. A task-specific flow may accompany the system-placement view, but
  neither visual may make a relationship the accepted source does not support.

No fleet regex can enforce this honestly: a crawler cannot infer canonical ownership,
primary-parent evidence, truthful framework placement or whether a generic link documents
a completed run. Enforce it in the semantic preflight, source-backed orbit manifest,
bidirectional-link verifier and rendered desktop/mobile review.

## Named entities link to the most helpful canonical destination

- **Route the first meaningful mention of a named entity to the page that best helps
  the reader understand or act on it.** Link once; do not turn every repeated name
  into a link. Use the entity's natural name for a person or company, and use 3–6
  descriptive words for a training or concept link.
- **People point to their verified personal-brand home.** Prefer the person's owned
  website over an author archive, search result or social profile. If no owned site can
  be verified, use the relevant first-party company page or a canonical article that
  establishes who the person is; otherwise leave the name plain.
- **Companies point to their owned company site.** Correct the entity name before
  linking it. A plausible domain for the wrong spelling teaches the wrong association.
- **Tools and concepts point to our canonical training when it exists.** In explanatory
  copy, use a destination-naming phrase such as "our Listen Notes inventory guide" for
  the definitive how-to page; do not point the bare product name at our domain. Put the
  product's natural name and official website on the execution step where the reader
  actually opens it. This preserves both education and a direct path to action without
  making the anchor lie about where it goes.
- **Verify every destination before publishing.** The name, page title and live content
  must identify the intended entity. SEO value is a by-product of a truthful,
  reader-helpful relationship; it is never a reason to guess a domain.

This extends `no-unnamed-link-text`: that rule makes the anchor truthful; this rule makes
the destination useful. When a bare entity name and a training page would conflict, the
destination-naming anchor above is the reconciliation. No generic fleet regex can identify
people, ownership or the right internal training page, so enforce this through the
entity-linking preflight and a live link audit.

<!-- shared-rule:public-documentation-auditable-truth:start -->
## Public documentation has one auditable truth

- **Publish one truth, not a fresh island inside a stale page.** A generator must own
  every claim derived from the same source: visible dates, counts, status cards,
  tables, changelog, links, metadata, and JSON-LD. On 2026-08-31 the Scheduled Jobs
  Fleet page showed a July 22 headline and eight automations around an August 25
  generated table with 53 rows. WordPress and RankMath carried the newer timestamp
  while the manual TechArticle schema carried the older one. Updating one HTML
  marker was therefore not an update to the document.
- **Render facts from typed canonical data.** Do not hand-copy a count, version,
  repository name, bundle name, cadence, or job status into prose. Generate it from
  the marketplace manifest, scheduler API, or other named owner. Label the unit:
  released skills, Task Library task records, scheduler definitions, observed jobs,
  and partner-specific agent roles are different things even when a page calls all of
  them “agents.”
- **Separate the clocks.** `last_checked` is when a named verifier compared the page
  with its sources. `last_changed` is when the public meaning last changed.
  `last_published` is when that revision reached the live URL. A no-change run advances
  only `last_checked` and still leaves a receipt. A generator write that changes only
  an inventory block does not advance the surrounding article's `last_changed` unless
  every dependent claim was reconciled.
- **Sign the document without replacing the expert.** Keep the human subject/author,
  and add the maintaining agent or scheduled job, exact model when the runtime exposes
  it (otherwise `UNKNOWN`), actual human reviewer or `not yet reviewed`, source URL and
  revision/commit, and a success or failure receipt. Never invent a reviewer or imply
  that an agent is the human expert. Public receipts and operational details still
  require the normal privacy and publication gate; every substantive run keeps a
  private receipt even when no public meta article is authorized.
- **Use one visible, semantic provenance rail.** Put the audit fields in an `<aside>`
  or `<section>` marked `data-document-provenance="verified"`, with the data attributes
  enforced above, a receipt ID and honest reviewer state, plus visible `<time>` elements
  whose datetimes exactly match both checked and changed clocks. `datePublished`
  stays separate. Schema `dateModified` must equal the visible clock for the public
  revision: normally `last_changed` on a static article, or `last_checked` when a
  no-change verification itself creates a new evidence-page revision. Preserve both
  clocks in the rail and allow only one publisher/Article owner to describe the document.
- **Prove scheduled state with execution receipts.** “Scheduled” means a definition
  exists. “Observed” means a firing left an immutable timestamped success or failure
  receipt containing timezone, runtime, stable job/run ID, source revision, result,
  destination, and live readback. Expire one-shots after their run window and classify
  disabled, paused, archived, failed, and unknown work separately from active work.
- **Fail visibly and fail closed.** If a source cannot be fetched, a scheduled check
  leaves no receipt, a reviewer has not reviewed, or values conflict, show `unknown`,
  `stale`, or `verification failed`; do not stamp “updated.” Cache-fill time is never
  a content-modified time.
- **Keep the knowledge graph reciprocal.** Every pillar, spotlight, partner page,
  definitive article, task, skill, and authorized meta article links back to its
  canonical owner and forward to the relevant examples and receipts. Reuse the shared
  spine: The System · Content Factory · Task Library · canonical skills/install ·
  Scheduled Jobs · receipt/meta policy · changelog.

The sweep proves that the required rail and semantic timestamp exist. It cannot prove
that the named person reviewed the page, that the source revision is genuine, or that
two numbers mean the same unit. Those assertions require source comparison and receipt
readback during the audit; passing the regex is necessary, never sufficient.
